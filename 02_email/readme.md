# Think Computationally with Python: How to Think about Automating Email

In this liveProject, you will be acting as a high school teacher. You have just finished reading your very first Python programming book. In true teacher (and lifelong-learner) fashion, you want to use your newly learned skills to become more efficient in a part of your job that doesn’t really focus on teaching: sending out grades to your students. Your students have just answered three questions about an assigned book. You’d like to send everyone an email with their scores on each question, along with any comments you have. Additionally, you’d like to pick a student at random to talk about the book in front of the class.

As you are grading, you maintain an Excel spreadsheet of student names and emails, and you populate it with a breakdown of each question score and any comments you may have for the student. You’ll write a program that can automatically grab this information and send out a customized email to each student containing their score and comments. Additionally, if they were randomly chosen to present, you’ll mention this in their email message as well.

## Techniques employed
- Understanding how an email message is structured and sent
- Reading documentation for a Python library you’ve never seen before
- Parsing a CSV file to extract and store information in a relevant data structure

## Project outline

This liveProject is divided into four milestones.

1. Understanding the Sample Exam Data

2. Saving Data from the File

3. Reading about SMTP and Using the smtplib Python Library

4. Composing the Email Message

This will be the first time you have to rely heavily on using an external library to achieve your goal, so it’s important to make sure you understand how it works. You will have to rely on external resources for this—don’t be afraid to use them!
